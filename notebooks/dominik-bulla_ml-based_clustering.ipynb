         "I live with two people in my family who have schizophrenia and there was a butcher knife placed on a picture of me iâm a 19 year old cc student and i live with my grandma, mom, uncle, aunt, and little sister.\n\nmy mom has a meth addiction and sheâs developed schizophrenia from it and itâs been getting worse as the years go on. my uncle was hit on the head at a young age and im not exactly sure what he struggles since we never talk but i think itâs schizophrenia. my mom doesnât take her meds i think and my grandma is constantly trying to help her with moving in and out of motels and rehabs and all this stuff for the past 8 months or so (realistically sheâs been trying to help her for many many years now but my mom had moved out) recently my mom moved back in like a week ago. my uncle is very strange and i donât know really anything about him. he leaves his room a few times a day and doesnât talk to anyone, sometimes i hear him talk to himself in his room, but he doesnât yell and scream like my mom does, heâs just very quiet and intense. \n\nso earlier tonight i was using my grandmas phone for school since mine was dead, and i got curious to look in her messages between my mom because iâve seen messages between them before where my mom is talking about how  she hears voices talking about someone wanting to kill me and how sheâs constantly was thinking about me and she doesnât think iâm safe. so i looked and my aunt (sheâs mentally well) sent my grandma a picture where she found a big butcher knife placed on top of a picture of me. \n\nthe message said â*uncles name* is acting strange again. i asked *moms name* if she did this and she said she didnât. does *uncles name* know what it means to stab someone? that they will die?â in the photo my aunt sent my grandma, the picture of me was in like a mouse pad that was custom made with a photo of me from 4th grade. the thing is iâm not sure if itâs a coincidence because the mouse pad is on a desk for like where a computer used to be but the desk in like directly connected to the kitchen like almost next to it, so it could be possible that someone had happened to place that knife there so i didnât really freak out. but i talked to some friends and when i kinda said it out loud to them i did kinda realize like damn that does kinda sound bad and they told me that yea itâs probably not safe. \n\ni donât know if it was my uncle or mom either though, if it even was intentional. my uncle used to come home and hit me in the head as a kid a lot, and we would yell and scream at each other (we lived together for like 6 years and this would happen, then we moved, then we moved again and he moved back in with us) but ever since we moved back in again we literally do not talk to each other at all. heâs very awkward around me and everyone tbh and quiet, and i can tell he doesnât like to be in the same room as me even though i do not interact with him at all whatsoever. weâve said hey to each other like less than 10 times over the years and thatâs about it. he does kinda seem like he hates me but i donât think he would want to kill me. on the other hand itâs possible that my mom was lying to my aunt, but from what iâve seen i donât think my mom wants to kill me either. whenever she has talked about me in that way itâs more of a âthis is my son i need to protect him from whoever gonna kill himâ type of way rather than a malicious tone. but again, they are both schizophrenic which i really donât know much about besides they can be unpredictable and so thatâs why iâm asking. \n\ni know itâs weird to ask about this on reddit but i really donât have anyone to talk to about it. iâm not going to directly confront my uncle about it because again we are very distant and heâs a big guy i just donât want to i feel like itâd be worse, and i donât want to ask my mom because i know she would say no even if she did. iâm going to ask my grandma tomorrow since i havenât been able to since sheâs been asleep all night, but sheâs just going to ignore me after i express my concerns, which she always does. i can talk to my aunt about it even though weâre not really too close but yeah. \n\nanother thing is my grandma sent the photo my aunt sent her to my uncle asking if he did it and he kind of just ignored it, didnât deny it so. but yea i cant really move out or anything, i donât have the money for that since i just graduated high school and honestly i donât have a job right now since iâm a full time student and i just donât know where i would go. i donât have any friends that would let me live with them either so thatâs out of the picture . the best thing iâm hoping for is the convince my grandma to have them move out but thatâll probably never happen even though i want it to so bad. i just donât know if this is a coincidence with the knife and i shouldnât be worried or what i should do so yea pls help",

         "Crazy how powerful thought diaries &amp; breathing techniques have been for my anxiety  I've been undergoing therapy for anxiety and depression for the past two months. My therapist recommended that I start keeping a \"thought diary\" to write down any worries or concerns that I may have and to practice a breathing technique that involves breathing in for four seconds, holding for two, and then exhaling for four seconds.\n\nInitially, I was skeptical that these simple practices could make a difference in something that has troubled me for years. However, I began to notice that whenever I started to become consumed by anxious or depressive thoughts, jotting them down in my diary helped me immensely. This process allowed me to break down those thoughts and identify that 99% of the time, my worries and depression stem from hypothetical situations.\n\nFor instance, one of my thoughts was, \"What if my friends are judging me behind my back?\" (for context, this was after we went out for drinks). The key phrase in that being 'What if', meaning it's just hypothetical with no real evidence to back up the worry. So, in my thought diary, alongside my worrisome thought, I would write down a 'Helpful thought' where I deconstruct this worry. For the aforementioned thought, my helpful thought was:\n\n\"This is a hypothetical worry, you have no evidence to suggest this will happen. Your friend's opinion of you shouldn't be taken seriously anyway. You don't need to seek approval from your friends.\"\n\nOf course, this may not help everyone, but I wanted to share how thought diaries have helped my mental health, and they can be quite powerful.\n\n TL;DR: My therapist recommended keeping a \"thought diary\" and practicing breathing techniques to help my anxiety and depression. Writing down my thoughts and using the breathing technique has helped me identify that 99% of my worries are hypothetical. I recommend trying it out.",

Magnesium also reduces the production of cytokines and cortisol, which lead to increased inflammation and stress.\n\nIt's important that you don't over do it as you can poison yourself with magnesium, and you also have to make sure it's aspartate, citrate, lactate, and chloride forms as oxide apparently doesn't absorb as well.\n\nSpeak to your pharmacist or Dr if you're mixing medication, but I have been able to reduce the amount of lorazapam I've needed since starting mag and its helped a lot with sleep.

I wonât eat something thatâs been already opened regardless of whether or not itâs mine, which has led to me not only wasting food, but actively avoiding eating unless I make it right there, and even then it takes quite a bit of effort.  This in turn has also led me to having a fear of an undiagnosed mental illness, and I canât quite afford to go to a doctor currently to figure out if that is the case.\n\nIâve only ever been technically âdruggedâ once when the cannabis my friend bought was laced with PCP a few months ago but this fear extends back to when I was around fifteen (twenty three now).  Iâve done acid only twice and while I did enjoy it, itâs not something Iâm likely to do again, and I rarely smoke cannabis or drink, but I did do a lot of both for a few years.\n\n  Obviously nobody is gonna waste good acid on me but the fear is constantly there to the point that I yelled at my brother the other day for jokingly pretending to drop something into my Gatorade on the way to work (heâs unaware of this fear) and threw it away despite it being completely full, and even avoided eating the cookies my mom brought down for Christmas, which made me feel awful as there is absolutely no way my mom would ever do anything like that to me.\n\nIâm iffy on telling anybody close to me about this fear for a few reasons, the main one being the irrationality of it all, but I also do not want to be sent to an inpatient center (again, canât afford it) as I was for depression as a minor.  Sorry for the rambling wall of text but I just need to know if this is signs of a more major illness or at the very least how I can possibly cope with it.",

The day before appointment I went gym &amp; done some light training on back muscles which really set it off, was painful &amp; felt weird afterwards like weakness in my arms, bit dizzy and just a general weak feeling like really weak and disorientated. She was not helpful at all, basically done a quick opâs check, checked my back briefly &amp; said it seems ok. She said to rest on weekend and see how I go, she said hot water bottle. The more im thinking about my appointment with a her yesterday I get the impression she feels I was drug seeking. I never asked for any drugs but I feel she was misunderstanding me being concerned with trying to get drugs. She said something when I sat down like âyouâre looking to discuss pain managementâ I didnât really take it in as was really anxious and tired so I said yeah about my spine then proceeded to talk about my concerns, but not once did I say anything about wanting medications/drugs. Iâm annoyed now I should of been clear that I would of liked a referral to be checked out or something. Iâm on pregabalin for anxiety (it also just happens to be a nerve pain drug) and she said few times about youâll have review soon with usual GP to see if itâs helping my anxiety and not just about pain management. She also said youâve only upped dosage 10 days ago. I didnât really take it in properly at the time but I feel she thinks I was trying to up my dose or get pain meds? Iâm worried now that it will be on my notes and Iâm also frustrated that I didnât correct her properly. Any advice or help on this would be appreciated im very anxious about this, I feel I was totally misunderstood and I donât like the thought of her putting on notes I was looking for pain management or medication to help that. I also noticed as I was leaving she done a frustrated sigh. This experience has made me feel invalidated, misunderstood and made my anxiety and depression worse.

Never being able to focus and always the most loud and distributive( in school). I used to stay up at night as a kid because after watching the slightest scary movie I would be afraid.

I find it very hard to focus and have lots of thoughts at once. Even some that just pop into my head. I can hear other peoples tone of voice. Not like big conversation. My anxiety was so high I was getting lots of physical symptoms heart palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath to which I thought I had a heart problem. So I went to the doctors and got all the tests and didnât believe my heart was fine until I got the results. I thought about this everyday. To which now I think this might had been a delusion. My point is Iâm very worried Iâm developing Schizophrenia.

I need some advice/help (Gonna be a little long, gonna rant a bit)\n\nLittle back story, 20-year-old male, no past history of major anxiety other than flying on planes etc..\n\nLast year from January to April was feeling the best I have ever felt in my life! worked out 6-7 days a week, confidence was high, and not a care in the world. I would say around May, I started getting increasingly fatigued every day. As the days went on, it felt like I was detached from reality. By the end of the year, I felt so detached, fatigued, and had major brain fog. I have a small bump on the back of my head, it doesn't hurt, I got it checked out and the doc said it could be a skull deformity. I dont believe her.  I convinced myself that I had something wrong with me, and I went down the rabbit hole of self-diagnosing by reading google (i know worst idea ever). I could only function to the fraction I could before my snapping point. I felt so depolarized and had no energy at this point. I convinced myself I had a chronic illness that I was going to die from (I still belive this), I got every scan and lab work done. Nothing came of it. I had no idea what was causing all of these symptoms. Fast forward to January, I started a very stressful college class. It is an intensive academy-type class. I thought I had my stress pretty well controlled but in February I had my first panic attack ever. Went to school that day feeling fine, didn't eat breakfast, but drank 180mg of caffeine (I usually have \\~300mg a day). During the afternoon portion of the class, I felt this sense of impending doom, and shortness of breath and it felt like my heart was going to jump out of my chest.  For 2 hours my HR was in the \\~130s. I had no Idea what was going on and felt like I was gonna die. So my teacher wanted me transported to the ER, My EKG came back normal, sinus tachycardia (fast heart rate). They pulled labs and everything was normal except for low magnesium and potassium. They gave me some fluids and discharged me. For the next few days my heart rate was a constant 120 even when resting and my anxiety was through the roof! It sucked! My doctor then prescribed me Lexapro, and man oh man, hats of to anyone that could get through that first phase of Lexapro. It trashed me, constant panic attacks, SOB, tingling, the whole 9 yards. I stopped after 5 days due to the fact that I didn't want to be tied to a pill at such a young age. Since my panic attack, Ive had constant anxiety. Im having anxiety about things Ive never worried about before! it sucks! Its like I have to experience all these things over again (like driving) to tell myself there is nothing to be anxious about. Ill also be sitting in the most comfortable place in my house, not stressed at all, then my heart rate will kick off to the \\~120s for the whole day. Do you guys experience this? I also feel like I'm having heart palpitations. It feels like my heart is in my throat and I can't catch my breath. It sucks! Every time I stand up my heart rate jumps. It takes a long time for me to calm down and convince myself I'm not dying. I know my case is minor to some cases Ive read but damn Im having a hard time with this. Im in constant fear and anxious about having another anxiety attack and passing out. Im trying everything I can before I commit to an antidepressant. Im trying L  theanine, Ashwagandha, and magnesium. I got prescribed adarax but it doesn't seem to help like ativan does. I just want my old life back. Is this normal? Does it get better? will it be like this forever? how did you guys get over your anxiety? tips? medications? Thank you all for taking time and reading my post I really appreciate it.

I don't see any actual black or decay, just an indent that was hiding behind some tartar, but everyone's always told me that once you can see a cavity it's already too far and the tooth usually needs to be pulled (might not be true, just what I've been told) \n     I'm hopefully going to make an appointment on Monday but I'm so nervous because my teeth are terrible. I don't have any missing or rotting teeth but I can never remember to brush them and I had hg a couple years ago that turned into a 3 year long problem of throwing up multiple times a day.

He also changed the position of my bedtable And I feel like ripping my skin of, I can't stand the feeling, and goddamn HE HAD SCHOOL CLOTHES ON. And went in. My. Bed. I changed the sheets not a while ago and they were all clean and now not. I  don't even allow myself to lay in my bed with dirty clothes. I need to shower, put on fresh clothes and then I can lay in my bed. I had the problem of people just simply touching anything in my bed since I was little, They always bullyed me and extra jump on it, ect. I always cried because of it and It still didnt change. I'm so sensitive about anyone on my bed, I even feel disgusted if my mom sits on it just a tiny bit. There is no excuse ,everyone I know makes me uncomfortable when beeing on my bed. Does it have to do with my adhd? Is it autism? OCD? PTSD? or am I just weird? I'm slowly going insane, someone help me.",

The last few weeks has gotten more noticeable. Last night I kept seeing shadows to the point I could not move of the couch until I forced myself too. All day itâs been happening, thinking I see things like figures and having images that are horror related  come into my head.

         "4 years ago I wasnt showering for months at a time, depressed, anxious and paranoid. At the time I was sober going on 18, 19 years. I was, and am on disability since 09' for schizoaffective bipolar type disorder. \n\nFor the longest time, especially since sobriety, I've been overwhelmed with thinking. Space, time, behavior, tornadoes...whatever. \n\nBut, since my life was an unmanaged train wreck I had no confidence in myself as having any quality. It seems that feeling good about yourself comes from a well managed life.   \n\n\nMy last job was as a janitor on the army base near by roughly 5 years ago. I couldnt handle the pressure. I was so dependant on others for everything I was asking if I was sweeping properly. Very bad mindset. A lady mentioned crying and it made me feel like crying. I didnt understand how that could be. It seemed like witchcraft, so to speak. That was my last day at my last job. It was my 4th attempt to go back to work since my disability badge acquisition! \n\nI've been in therapy for 16 or 17 years ago I got into therapy from a mental health episode. During that visit at the crisis stabilisation unit in Virginia (Fredricksburg) I met a man that changed my life. He went by the name Bose Uncle. He taught me a breathing exercise. 3 in 6 out. You breath in deep for 3 seconds roughly then out for 6 seconds. Also roughly. Dont try to be specific like me and do it exactly 3 and 6. \n\nOn down the road, life and me under pressure and practicing my breathing because sufferage bleep blop bloop, pandemic. Overwhelming, unadulteraded pain in the brain from an anxiety I'd never expierenced before I saw a vision. It seemed to be the exact same thing that happened to Bill Wilson from AA. A wind blew through me. His words. My words on it are, I was no longer a bound up point in time and space holding on to the memories from the stimulation from the moment. I was free from the tension that came about from the fucking utter bullshit that exists. I let it go. The moment. I stopped holding and figuring. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like my being afraid got wore out. I remember specifiaclly saying to myself at the height of my pain in a ridgid bodily posture laying in my recline, \"bullshit.\" I calle dbullshit on my old beliefs. That old fire and brimstone god. Intstead I chose \"my concept\" of life as my God. My ideas are good to. Changed life.   \n\n\nAbout six months later I nearly died from pancreatitis. When I got home from 6 days in the hospital I shared it on facebook. I received a good number of get well soon messages as expected. I did not get what I thought I would. People coming to visit, bringing me food...all that. I nearly fucking died. I know hundreds of people. What does that mean? My perception is fucked up, my beghhvior is fucked up, I need to change.   \n\n\nI did not think that way at first. At first I thought, \"I fucking hate everyone.\" For a while. \n\nThen 6 months later, I got diagnosed with autism. April 24th 2021.   \n\n\n6 months later after learning to relax, I rested on my heels for the first time in my life. This began the second chapter of my life. The taking my time portion. The I am the most impotant person in my life to me. You all come second. For ever. I no longer run to the kitchen, the bathroom, through the grocery store, drive fast, or move my limbs fast. I have even taken control of my eyes speed of movement.   \n\n\nDid you know that your body can control your mind. If you dont control your body your body will be controlled by your environment throught the mind.   \n\n\nYou receive stimulus simply due to being a sensing being. This moves you. If you are not aware of it. Make yourself aware of this and take control of your body, the way you look, smell, move (behavior speed) amplitude of voice ...total bodily control and you can eliminate a great deal of your own suffering. I havew come off my depression meds and greatfully have finally been more aptly medicated with litium. Now I dont have to force myself into slow mo behavior but I do stay aware I think from a bit of fear.   \n\n\nYou can control your thinking!   \n\n\nYou can control your thinking!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish I could impress upon whomever needs it that the pause in conversation is ok. Moving the body oddly slow is not odd. Not speaking is an answer. And, you dont owe a motherfucker a goddamn thing if it stresses you out.\n\n Peace in east!",

My anxiety sucks so bad. I feel like most days it controls who i am and what i act like for that day. Today i went out with my friends and we had a good time but we ended up being outside a lot longer than we would and i got extremely cold and started panicking. We were far from everyoneâs house and all i wanted was to go home. They came to my house afterwards and it was nice for a while but i was still feeling anxious. When they all left i felt immediately better like this huge weight on my chest being lifted off. itâs not that i donât like my friends but being around people is so exhausting. I hate that im like this i just wanna feel normal so bad. I get anxious so easily and it wonât go away for hours. Then when iâm not feeling anxious i feel depressed. It constantly feels like a never ending storm or something. Like just when it starts to feel bright and the rain might stop it starts again and gets so dark. Iâm constantly fighting just to stay sane and itâs so hard. All i want is to feel normal and okay, and maybe real because iâm constantly dissociating. (I do have a therapist btw)",
