StressSense is a smart mental wellbeing app.

You type in whatâ€™s going on/what's on your mind, and the system figures out if youâ€™re feeling stressed or anxious. It then categorises your input into a theme like work stress, family issues, exam pressure, relationships, etc. Based on that theme, it suggests quick, practical tips - like a 2-min breathing exercise, a journaling prompt, or, if needed, crisis support.

The idea is to go beyond just detecting stress, and act like a mini coach that understands what youâ€™re going through and offers something small but helpful right away! ðŸ˜Œ
